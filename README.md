### Built with

- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first
- Tailwind CSS
- React.JS
- Redux Library
- React Router Library

### What I learned

- that was a good React project experience i learned how to fetch data, i know that not the best using useEffect
- handling api request
- using redux to handle global state
- using react router for making small routes and navigation
- handling slice and use it in different places
- handling error and using custom hook to make cleaner code and reusable

### Continued development

i would try next time using tanstack(react query) to handle that data better the project was
small and did not need that complex and i was a bit more comfort with redux than react query
so i used it normally without even using middleware to handle the call also cause i need only
one call to fetch data and save it but also best practice to use this cool tools that really made
life better
